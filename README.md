A successful simple I Love Horses stack smash exploit for the Nintendo DS that can execute unsigned code from the savegame.

* These are ARM9 exploits that takes over a NDS mode cartridge. These type of exploits are very limited since there's no SD or NAND access. They can be used to run a small payload. These exploits are almost useless.

## Requirements:
* A copy of the `I Love Horses` NDS game (US/EUR)
* Any DS that's in the NDS family (NDS, NDSL, DSi, DSiXL, 3DS, 3DSXL, NEW3DS, NEW3DSXL, 2DS, 2DSXL, etc.)
* A way to inject the save. (DSi users can use [ndsi-savedumper](https://github.com/edo9300/ndsi-savedumper) and 3DS users can use [TWLSaveTool](https://github.com/TuxSH/TWLSaveTool/releases).
###
## Triggering the exploit
* Select the `HORSESLOVEHAXX` save-slot (the white horse)
* Tap the `START` on the bottom screen
* The payload should load! :D
###
## Support:
* Supports both US & EUR versions of the game.
* Works with emulators. (no$gba, TWiLightMenu++, etc.)
